CS121-VehiCool
==================
VehiCool is an app that allows car enthusiasts and travelers to keep track of all the license plates they see on the road or in their travels. Our app allows the user to quickly line-up and snap a photo of a license plate using their android device's back camera, and then tag the plate with useful information. The user can then search and view all of their stored plates to enjoy their growing collection of funny, exotic, or faraway license plates.
